# Topy - a tool for visualizing and analyzing retinotopic data

This is a _Mathematica_ package for analyzing retinotopic mapping data collected in the classical method: handmapped receptive fields drawn on a spherical screen. The package performs basic geometrical calculations based on spherical coordinates, and allows the researchers to explore the dataset easily. My colleagues and I have used this package to generate figures in a number of publications. 

## Examples:

Hadjidimitrakis et al. (2019) Topographic Organization of the 'Third-Tier' Dorsomedial Visual Cortex in the Macaque. _Journal of Neuroscience_ 39, 5311-5325.

The stylistic elements in Topy is flexity. You can visualize your data in many different ways:

## How to use it?
1. Move the `Topy` to a place that _Mathematica_ can find, such as `~/Library/Mathematica/Applications`
2. Consult one of the scripts in `demo/`.
