# Topy - a tool for visualizing and analyzing retinotopic data

This is a _Mathematica_ package for analyzing retinotopic mapping data collected in the classical method: handmapped receptive fields drawn on a spherical screen. The package performs basic geometrical calculations based on spherical coordinates, and allows the researchers to explore the dataset easily. My colleagues and I have used this package to generate figures in a number of publications.
